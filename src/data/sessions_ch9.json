  "summary": "After looting the black dragons’ hoard, the group marches toward Castle Naerytar. Outside its walls, they face waves of cultists and drakes before a brutal confrontation with Aldous Khosann and his Black Eagles cavalry.",
  "full_text": "With the dragons defeated and their hoard claimed, the group invests in a second Bag of Holding from Mammon, ensuring they can carry the immense weight of their newfound riches. Their next destination: Castle Naerytar — a place whispered to be central to the Cult of the Dragon’s plans. As they approach, Paimon scouts ahead, reporting a sprawling encampment surrounding the fortress, filled with cult tents, watchtowers, and the stench of draconic corruption.\n\nWasting no time, the group strikes first. The initial wave of defenders consists of kobolds, guard drakes, mounted cultists riding giant lizards, and even several young black dragons. Though numerous, they are no match for the seasoned heroes. The party’s spells and steel carve through their ranks, though the skirmish drains a fair share of their resources.\n\nAfter a short retreat to regroup and recover, the group returns to finish the job. Near the castle’s gate, they encounter Ghesh, a fanatic commander of the Cult, leading a fresh detachment of soldiers. The battle erupts violently — Ghesh and his forces fall one after another, their zeal no match for the group’s precision and fury.\n\nBut the momentary calm shatters as the sound of hooves echoes across the swamp. The Black Eagles charge into the battlefield under the command of Aldous Khosann, their banners glinting in the murky light. The sudden cavalry assault throws the group into chaos, and for the first time in a long while, doubt seeps in. A string of tactical missteps pushes the heroes to the brink.\n\nDespite the overwhelming odds, the adventurers persevere. Through sheer willpower and resilience, they break the Black Eagles’ advance and bring Aldous and his riders to defeat. Exhausted but alive, the group surveys the battlefield — a wasteland of corpses, broken weapons, and scorched ground. They set camp once more, tending to their wounds and gathering strength for what awaits within the ominous walls of Castle Naerytar."

    "Dralmorrer",

  "summary": "The group infiltrates Castle Naerytar through a hidden entrance, encountering Bullywugs, Dralmorrer, and the Red Wizard Azbara Jos. The battle ends with Dralmorrer’s death and Azbara’s escape through a portal.",
  "full_text": "After a much-needed long rest, the group advances toward the interior of Castle Naerytar, entering through the same breach where they had previously spotted the Bullywugs. A skirmish breaks out almost immediately, though Advenssax makes a sincere effort to spare the creatures. Despite his attempts, a few of the Bullywugs fall before peace can be restored. Through determination and broken gestures, Advenssax manages to calm the survivors, ending the conflict before more blood is spilled.\n\nPressing deeper into the castle’s damp corridors, the adventurers are suddenly approached again by the Bullywugs — this time, frantic and seemingly trying to warn them of danger ahead. Soren, unable to understand their croaking language, hastily purchases a scroll to communicate. With the spell cast, he instructs the Bullywugs to flee and shares grim news: the black dragons they served are dead.\n\nThe group continues forward, navigating through dark stone halls and strange, echoing chambers until they encounter two formidable foes: Dralmorrer, an elven warrior tied to the Cult of the Dragon, and Azbara Jos, a Red Wizard of Thay. The clash is immediate and vicious. Spells explode through the air, steel rings against arcane shields, and the tension builds until Dralmorrer finally falls to the group’s combined might. Azbara Jos, recognizing the inevitable, conjures his magic and escapes through a portal shimmering with crimson light.\n\nChasing their quarry, the adventurers push deeper into the castle, discovering a natural cavern beneath its foundation. There, the Bullywug chieftain emerges, desperate to defend his domain, but Soren and Advenssax persuade him to flee rather than fight. Yet even as the chieftain retreats, more enemies pour forth, forcing one last battle before the group reaches the portal’s edge.\n\nWithout hesitation, they step through the magical gateway — unaware of what lies beyond, but ready to face whatever awaits on the other side."
